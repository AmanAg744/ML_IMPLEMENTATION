AI - application doing things without human intervention
    eg NEtflix recommender algo, Amazon related search algo

ML - subset of AI , provides stats tools to analyze the data and visualize the data to do predictions and forecasting.
    statistics

DL - subset of ML (like how human brain learns) multi layer neural networks

DS  - does everything learns ML,DL and implments them to create AI



ML - Supervised - Regression
                - Classification

   - Unsupervised - Clustering (Dimentionality Reduction)


E.G - Supervised ML
    Independent Feature - usually the input 
    Dependent Feature - output from the model

Regression -  output will be a continous variable
Classification - True/false type or a fixed number of categories as the output
               - Binary Classification - only 2 categories as output


Unsupervised - Clustering , Dimentionality Reduction

Clustering - No output or dependent variable so we cluster or group the data based on similarities
           - Each cluster defines some property of the data grouped in
           - used in Customer Segmentation for Marketing or Market Analysis

Dimentionality Reduction - convert or lower the dimensions of the data - grouping algo 
                         - like PCA (Principle Compomnent Analysis) 

Decision Tree - Both Classification and Regression

ADABoost , Random Forest , Gradient Boost , XG Boost, Naive Bayes, KNN


Clustering --
K means clustering 
Hierarical
DBscan 
KNN
PCA 


started learning using the CampusX ML playlist
this will teach me to stay consistent and learn and break my bad learning cycle developed during the last sem

LDA

SVM
